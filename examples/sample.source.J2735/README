GENERAL INFORMATION
===================

The SAE J2735-201603 Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC)
Message Set Dictionary decoder.
Invoking `make` will compile the ASN.1 specifications from the
../j2735.asn1 file.

THERE IS NO j2735.asn1 FILE THERE YET!

OBTAINING THE J2735 SPECIFICATION
=================================

Go to http://standards.sae.org/j2735_201603/ and download the files.

You should extract the ASN.1 module from there and save it
as the ../j2735.asn1 file. The ../j2735.asn1 file should start with
the following line
	"DSRC DEFINITIONS AUTOMATIC TAGS ::="
and end with the "END" token.
Be careful not to copy any non-ASN.1 preambles from that .DOC file.

After obtaining the j2735.asn1, type `make` in the directory containing
this README file.

j2735-dump USAGE
================

The j2735-dump utility may be used to dump the contents of the UPER-encoded
DSRC message record file:

	./j2735-dump j2735file.per	# Print as XML (BASIC-XER)

The full list of recognized command line options may be obtained with

	> ./j2735-dump -h
