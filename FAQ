Q: Your compiler supplies a der_encode() procedure. How do I encode BER?
A:
	The DER (and CER) are stricter subsets of a more generic BER encoding
	method. If you encode data with DER or CER, all BER-conformant decoders
	will easily understand that. Hence, to encode data in the BER format,
	simply use the DER encoder, der_encode().

	See also:	ISO/IEC 8825-1 / X.690:
			"ASN.1 encoding rules: Specification of
			 Basic Encoding Rules (BER),
			 Canonical Encoding Rules (CER) and
			 Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER)"
