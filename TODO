1. MAJOR:

1.1 Support for PER encoding. Requires advanced subtype constraints support,
which is already completed. Also see #3.2.

1.2 Support for Information Object Classes.
   Status:	Support for parsing IOCs is mostly present.
		Support for slicing the IOCs to produce "views"
		is not yet designed.

2. MEDIUM:

2.1 Support for DEFAULT encoding and decoding, at least in INTEGER/ENUMERATED types.
2.2 Support for EXTERNAL, EMBEDDED-PDV and CHARACTER STRING types.

3. MINOR:

3.1 Parsing of CONSTRAINED BY clauses

3.2 Support for ContainedSubtype constraint.

3.3 If the generated target language source file is not different from
the one already present (except maybe a compiler version in comments), 
do not update the file. Prevents trashing file dependencies in multifile
compilation.
